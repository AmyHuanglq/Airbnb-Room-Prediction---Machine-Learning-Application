# Airbnb-Room-Prediction---Machine-Learning-Application
This project developed a prediction model for Airbnb bookings, using Random Forest and feature importance analysis to estimate the number of days a listing would be booked in the next 30 days. This experience honed my ability to forecast demand and optimize pricing and marketing budgets, a key skill for estimating future campaign expenses.
